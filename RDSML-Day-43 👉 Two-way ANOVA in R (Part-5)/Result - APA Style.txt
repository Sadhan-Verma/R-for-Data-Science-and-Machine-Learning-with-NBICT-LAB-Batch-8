A two-way ANOVA examined the effects of fertilizer (Control, N, N+P) and irrigation (High, Low) on yield with equal cell sizes (n = 20 per cell; N = 120). Assumption checks indicated no serious violations: residuals were approximately normal (Shapiro–Wilk p = .585) and variances were homogeneous (median-based Levene’s test), F(5, 114) = 0.62, p = .688. The analysis showed a large main effect of fertilizer, F(2, 114) = 69.67, p < .001, partial η² = .55, and a large main effect of irrigation, F(1, 114) = 58.73, p < .001, partial η² = .34. The interaction was not significant, F(2, 114) = 1.16, p = .316, partial η² = .02. Descriptively, yields were higher under High (M ≈ 66.23) than Low irrigation (M ≈ 57.50). By fertilizer, Control produced lower yields (M ≈ 52.30) than N (M ≈ 66.50) and N+P (M ≈ 66.80), whereas N and N+P did not differ meaningfully. Tukey-adjusted simple effects aligned with these patterns: within each irrigation level, both N and N+P exceeded Control (all ps < .0001), and N did not differ from N+P (ps ≥ .53); within each fertilizer, High exceeded Low irrigation by 7.40–11.03 units (ps ≤ .0003). Complementary effect-size estimates were similar (ω²_partial: fertilizer = .53, irrigation = .32, interaction ≈ .00). No standardized residuals exceeded |3|, and a small number of observations had modestly elevated Cook’s distances, but they did not alter conclusions. Cell means (M, SD) were: Control–High 56.2 (7.88), Control–Low 48.4 (6.66), N–High 72.0 (6.14), N–Low 61.0 (4.88), N+P–High 70.5 (5.51), N+P–Low 63.1 (6.23).
